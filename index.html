                The Dassault Rafale (French pronunciation: ​[ʁafal], literally
                meaning "gust of wind",[9] and "burst of fire" in a more
                military sense
                ter aircraft designed and built by Dassault
                Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the Rafale is
                intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial
                reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship
                strike.

                In the late 1970s, the French Air Force and French Navy were
                to replace and consolidate their current fleets of aircraft.
                In order to reduce development costs and boost prospective sales,
                France entered into an arrangement with UK, Germany, Italy and
                Spain to produce an agile multi-purpose fighter, the Eurofighter
                Typhoon. Subsequent disagreements over workshare and differing
                requirements led to France's pursuit of its own development
                programme. Dassault built a technology demonstrator which
                first flew in July 1986 as part of an eight-year flight-test
                programme, paving the way for the go-ahead of the project.
                The Rafale is distinct from other European fighters of its
                era in that it is almost entirely built by one country,
                involving most of France's major defence contractors,
                such as Dassault, Thales and Safran.</big>

                Many of the aircraft's avionics and features, such
                as direct voice input, the RBE2 AA active electronically
                scanned array (AESA) radar and the optronique secteur
                frontal infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor, were
                domestically developed
                and produced for the Rafale programme. Originally scheduled
                to enter service in 1996, the Rafale suffered significant
                delays due to post-Cold War budget cuts and changes in priorities. The aircraft
                 is available in three main variants:
                Rafale C single-seat land-based version, Rafale B twin-seat
                land-based version, and Rafale M single-seat carrier-based
                version.

                Introduced in 2001, the Rafale is being produced for both
                the French Air Force and for carrier-based operations in
                the French Navy. The Rafale has been marketed for export
                to several countries, and was selected for purchase by
                the Indian
                Air Force, the Egyptian Air Force, and the Qatar Air Force.
                The Rafale has been used in combat over Afghanistan, Libya,
                Mali, Iraq and Syria
